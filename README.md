## Compton

Unfortunately, Debian uses an old version of Compton. The new fork is called Picom, which is unavailable in the Debian repos.

I tried to use the `glx` backend but it crashes unless I take the `-b` flag off from the exec command in my i3 config.

Anyhow, I'm satisfied with what it's doing for me at the moment and will use this until something better comes along.
